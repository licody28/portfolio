        <h2>Amateur Botanist</h2>
        <p>Currently, I really love plants. I've been purchasing all sorts of <br>
        leafy & green plants from different shops and have amassed a giant <br>
        indoor home jungle composed of different species. I love how big they <br>
        grow and how it adds a nice nature-eqsue touch to my interior home.</p>

        <h2>Dog Owner</h2>
        <p>I have a 5 year old Shiba Inu named Lucky, who gets very spoiled by <br>
        me and overall impacts my mood in a positive manner. Taking him on walks <br>
        or just playing with him always gives me a positive mindset. </p>
